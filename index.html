    <p> Structural engineering problems can be complicated, but their solutions don’t have to be.  It’s easy to make things complicated.  Keeping it simple is much harder.  The art of engineering is balancing competing demands.  There are many demands acting on the structural engineer: technical requirements, business requirements, risk management, cost, schedule, constructability, and so on.  Good engineering balances all these demands as simply as possible, but not simpler.</p>

	<p>My approach to engineering is to focus on technical fundamentals and communication.  You can’t understand your own design without strong technical fundamentals and you cant explain it your client without excellent communication skills.</p>

<p>With that in mind, I have two objectives for this website:
	<ul>
		<li>1. To create a resource for concise, easy to understand technical information on the fundamentals of structural engineering and,</li>
		<li>2. Simple, practical tools for practicing engineers.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>I have only skimmed the surface of some topics and delved more deeply into others at my own discretion.  My ambition is not to produce a comprehensive on-line textbook.  Where I have delved deeply into a subject, I have tried to include sections for "people in a hurry" that get right to the point for people who lose interest.</p>

<p>I hope that my love of the source material come through in these (virtual) pages.  If one other person out there reads this site and is inspired to study structural engineering, I will consider it a success. </p>
